    "\n",
    "- For this project, we’ve used the data of 30 International Airports of India and tried to make it more meaningful. \n",
    "- Airport Name, Airport code, the city and state of the airport were all collected from different wikipedia pages and the latitude-longitude of these airports were collected from Google Maps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### This dataset is used for providing a complete package of information to travellers to make their interstate travel easy and comfy. The following information will be provided:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Suggests the nearest airport based on the users location.\n",
    "- All the important links at one place\n",
    "- Temperature of the destination to make packing easier\n",
    "- Suggests a list of things to do at the destination like famous restaurants to visit, hotels to stay."
